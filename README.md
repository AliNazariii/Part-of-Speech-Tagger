# Part-of-Speech-Tagger

A POS (Part-of-speech) tagger grammatically classifies the tokens (noun, verb, adjective...).

My base model for this task is [ParsBERT](https://github.com/hooshvare/parsbert/). It is a transformer-based model for Persian language understanding and a monolingual language model based on Googleâ€™s BERT architecture.

I've used [Bijankhan Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijankhan_Corpus) for this task. You can access it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cUSFYjYsz0aca3tjdzUVDsOaPedxDcEi/view?usp=sharing).
