# Part-of-Speech-Tagger

### Definition
A POS (Part-of-speech) tagger to grammatically classify tokens (noun, verb, adjective...) in a sentence.

### Model
I've used a pre-trained model name [ParsBERT](https://github.com/hooshvare/parsbert/), a transformer-based Persian language understanding model, and a monolingual one based on Google's BERT architecture.

### Data
I've used [Bijankhan Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijankhan_Corpus) for this task. You can access it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cUSFYjYsz0aca3tjdzUVDsOaPedxDcEi/view?usp=sharing).
